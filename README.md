# nonogram-engine

A prolog solution for [nonogram puzzles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram).
Included are multiple versions of the program. They all work, but have different branching order, which should optimize the process. 
It is still too slow for puzzles that are over 25 by 25 or are "complicated".

Still needs a GUI (input is now handled by pasting it on top of a file before running it)
